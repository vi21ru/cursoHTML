      Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has
      been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a
      galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five
      centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It
      was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum
      passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including
      versions of Lorem Ipsum. Why do we use it? It is a long established fact that a reader will be
      distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using
      Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using
      'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing
      packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search
      for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have
      evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the
      like).

      Contrary to popular belief, <strong>Lorem Ipsum</strong> is not simply random text. It has
      roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old.
      Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at <blockquote>College in Virginia </blockquote>, looked up one of
      the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a <em>Lorem Ipsum passage</em>, and going
      through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source.
      Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The
      Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC.
      <span id="resaltado" class="frase-resaltada"
        >This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics</span
      >, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit
      amet..", comes from a line in <i>section</i> 1.10.32.
